            <p>As we go further, the assignment gets more exciting and more hands on. Given that I did the practice for this chapter before starting the assignment it was not hard at all to manage 
                
                <br>it even made it easier to get through. The tricky part for me was remembering how to properly put the semantic elements and remembering what goes in each part.
             
                <br>To make sure I was doing everything right; I went back to watch the class recordings and watched a bro code video to verify everything was set properly. </p>

             <h3>What I learned:</h3>
             
             <ol>
                <li>How Semantic elements work and the order they should be placed.</li>
                <li>How to add a link to a website</li>
                <li>How to make the font of website italic or bold.</li>


             </ol>

            Learning about all the different elements that make an excellent html page, and a website must be the most thrilling part of this class.
            <br>Getting to see behind the scenes of the coding and what each semantic element does and how important they are is so exciting to me.
            <br>I learned a lot from:
